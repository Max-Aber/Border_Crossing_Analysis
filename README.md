# US Border Crossings Analysis (1996â€“2024)

This project uses information from the Bereau of Transportation Statistics to see and analyze long-term trends in US border crossings and assess the impact of major events (9/11, COVID-19, presidencies, etc.) on the volume of people and vehicles entering the country.

## Data

Data from [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/explore-topics-and-geography/geography/border-crossingentry-data) ([US Border Crossings Dataset](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/border-crossing-entry-data-683ae)) for inbound crossings into the U.S-Canada and the U.S.-Mexico border at the port level. Data shows the numbers for vehicles, containers, passengers, or pedestrians entering the United States. The data ranges from Jan 1996 to May 2024.

## Tools
